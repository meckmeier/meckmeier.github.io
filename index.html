  <p>Who am I? - I'm just another retired professional trying to find meaning in my life</p>
  <p>I used to work a lot with data - I love SQL Server! I was also pretty good at helping people understand how data could help them do fun stuff. Lately, I've been leveraging Chat GPT to learn how to code in HTML, CSS and Javascript. It seemed like this might be an area where small non-profits (doing good work for the world) could maybe use some volunteer help.</p>
  <p>Recently have been working thru the <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/home" alt="Front End Mentor">Front End Mentor Learning Paths.</a> I found that site after following a free class from <a href="" alt="Kevin Powell">Kevin Powell</a> - the course was on Responsive Web Design. I think Kevin is an EXCELLENT teacher, so if you are looking to get started with CSS, he is an great resource.</p>
